The ongoing global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread to the United Kingdom in January 2020.[4] Transmission within the UK was confirmed in February,[5] leading to an epidemic with a rapid increase in cases in March.[6] As of 4 April, there have been 41,903 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK,[nb 3][3] and 4,313 people with confirmed infection have died.[nb 1][3]
On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus had caused a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.[12] The UK subsequently developed a prototype specific laboratory test for the new disease.[13] The four UK Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January, upon the WHO's announcement of the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).[13] After cases appeared in the UK on 31 January a public health information campaign was launched to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus.[13] Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to introduce the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 statutory instrument.[12] Guidance on infection prevention and control, how to detect and diagnose COVID-19, and daily updates, including advice to travellers, have been published by the UK's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Public Health England (PHE).[12] In addition, the NHS set up COVID-19 drive-through screening centres at some hospitals.[14][15] The Chief Medical Officer for England, Chris Whitty, explained a four-pronged strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate.[16]
The earliest documented transmission within the UK appeared on 28 February 2020; all of the cases detected previously had been infected abroad.[5] By 1 March, cases had been detected in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.[12][17] Subsequently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled the Coronavirus Action Plan,[12] and the government declared the outbreak a "level 4 incident".[18] On 11 March, the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic.[6] Other responses included some schools in England choosing to close.[19] Airlines announced a number of flight cancellations,[20] and some online retailers reported consumers placing unusually large orders.[21] On 12 March, the UK risk level was raised from moderate to high.[22] Four days later, following the outbreak in Italy,[23] whose health system shares similar values and organisation to the NHS,[24] and based on evidence including forecasting by epidemiologists at Imperial College London,[25] the government advised on further measures on social distancing and advised people in the UK against "non-essential" travel and contact with others, as well as suggesting people should avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, and work from home if possible. Pregnant women, people over the age of 70, and those with certain health conditions were urged to consider the advice "particularly important", and were asked to self-isolate.[23]
On 18 March, it was announced that the UK would close all schools except for children of key workers and vulnerable children.[26] On 20 March, all restaurants, pubs, clubs and indoor sport and leisure facilities were ordered to close, though delivery and take-out chains were allowed to remain open.[27] On 23 March, the government announced that these measures were to be tightened further, with wide-ranging restrictions made on freedom of movement, enforceable in law,[28] resulting in the Coronavirus Act 2020, the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 and other similar statutory instruments covering the other home nations.

Background
On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. This cluster was initially linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City. However, some of those first cases with laboratory confirmed results had no link to the market, and the source of the epidemic is unknown.[29][30]
Unlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 [31][32] has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[33][31] COVID-19 typically appears with about seven days of flu-like symptoms followed by some people progressing to symptoms of a viral pneumonia requiring admission to hospital.[31] From 19 March COVID-19 was no longer classified as a "High consequence infectious disease".[32]
Timeline


On 22 January, following a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States the previous day, in a man returning to Washington from Wuhan, China, where there were 440 confirmed cases at the time, the DHSC and PHE raised the risk level from "very low" to "low". As a result, Heathrow Airport received additional clinical support and tightened surveillance of the three direct flights that it received from Wuhan every week; each were to be met by a Port Health team with Mandarin and Cantonese language support. In addition, all airports in the UK were to make written guidance available for unwell travellers.[36][37] Simultaneously, efforts to trace 2,000 people who had flown into the UK from Wuhan over the previous 14 days were made.[38]
On 31 January, two members of a family of Chinese nationals staying in a hotel in York, one of whom studied at the University of York, became the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK. Upon confirmation, they were transferred from Hull University Teaching Hospital to a specialist isolation facility, a designated High Consequence Infectious Diseases Unit in Newcastle upon Tyne.[4][39]
On the same day, an evacuation flight from Wuhan landed at RAF Brize Norton and the passengers, none of whom were showing symptoms, were taken to quarantine, in a staff residential block at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral.[40] There had previously been contention over whether the government should assist the repatriation of UK passport holders from the most affected areas in China, or restrict travel from affected regions altogether.[41][42] Some British nationals in Wuhan had been informed that they could be evacuated but any spouses or children with mainland Chinese passports could not.[43] This was later overturned, but the delay meant that some people missed the flight.[40]
February 2020 – Early spread
On 6 February, a third confirmed case, a man who had recently travelled to Singapore and then France, was reported in Brighton. He had been the source of infection to six of his relatives in France, before returning to the UK on 28 January.[44][45] Following confirmation of his result, the UK's CMOs expanded the number of countries where a history of previous travel associated with flu-like symptoms – such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing – in the previous 14 days would require self-isolation and calling NHS 111. These countries included China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.[46]
On 10 February, the total number of cases in the UK reached eight as four further cases were confirmed in people linked to the affected man from Brighton.[47][48] Globally, the virus had spread to 28 countries.[49] That day, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020, to give public health professionals "strengthened powers" to keep affected people and those believed to be a possible risk of having the virus, in isolation.[49] The following day, two of the eight confirmed cases in the UK were reported by BBC News to be general practitioners (GPs).[47] A ninth case was confirmed in London on 11 February.[50]
On 23 February, the DHSC confirmed a total of 13 cases in the UK as four new cases in passengers on the cruise ship Diamond Princess were detected. They were transferred to hospitals in the UK.[51]
On 27 February, the total number of confirmed cases in the UK were reported as 16, including the first case in Northern Ireland – a woman who had travelled from the outbreak area in northern Italy, having also stopped in Dublin.[52][53]
On 28 February, the first case in Wales was confirmed in a person who had returned from Northern Italy.[54][55][56] The same day, two further cases were confirmed in England, one of whom was a man who became the 20th case of COVID-19 in the UK and the first case who did not contract the disease from abroad. He was a resident in Surrey and registered at the Haslemere Health Centre, which had previously been closed for "deep cleaning".[5]
On 29 February, three further cases of the virus were confirmed, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 23, after 10,483 people had been tested.[12] Two of the three affected people had recently returned from Italy while the third had come back from Asia.[57] On the same day, Scottish CMO, Catherine Calderwood announced that surveillance would begin at some hospitals and 41 GP surgeries in Scotland.[58] Around 442,675 calls were made to the non-emergency line 111 in the last week of February.[59]

Supermarkets introduced early shopping hours for the elderly and vulnerable
On 17 March, NHS England announced that all non-urgent operations in England would be postponed from 15 April to free up 30,000 beds.[87] Also on 17 March, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that £330bn would be made available in loan guarantees for businesses affected by the pandemic.[88][89] On that day the UK death toll rose to 71, while the number of confirmed cases increased to 1,950.[90][91]
On 17 March, the government provided a £3.2million emergency support package to help rough sleepers into accommodation.[92][93] With complex physical and mental health needs, in general, homeless people are at a significant risk of catching the virus.[92]
On 18 March, MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle announced that he had tested positive for with the virus.[94] On 19 March, the first death was confirmed in Northern Ireland.[95] The Ministry of Defence also announced the formation of the COVID Support Force, enabling the military to support public services and civilian authorities in tackling the outbreak.[96] Two military operations were also announced: Operation Rescript, which focuses on the outbreak in the United Kingdom; and Operation Broadshare, which focuses on British military activities overseas.[97]

Next closed its 700 stores on 23 March, having previously traded with warning notices about the virus
On 20 March, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency announced that all pending practical and driving theory tests were to be postponed, for at least 3 months in the case of practical tests, and up to and including 20 April for theory tests. All candidates were to receive notification of when their tests were rescheduled.[98][99]
On 22 March, the UK death toll reached 281, including what was reported to be the virus's youngest British victim so far, an eighteen-year-old with underlying health problems.[100] On 23 March, Next was the latest retailer to announce that it was temporarily closing its 700 stores due to the pandemic. It predicted a £1bn loss in revenue due to the virus.[101][102] On the same day, Downing Street confirmed Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab was the "designated survivor" to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson if he became "incapacitated".[103]
Late March 2020
On 23 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in a television broadcast that measures to mitigate the virus were to be tightened further in order to protect the NHS, with wide-ranging restrictions made on freedom of movement, enforceable in law,[28] for a planned "lockdown" period intended to last for at least three weeks.[104] The government directed people to stay at home throughout this period except for essential purchases, essential work travel (if remote work was not possible), medical needs, one exercise per day (alone or with household members), and providing care for others.[105] Many other non-essential activities, including all public gatherings and social events except funerals, were prohibited, with many categories of retail businesses ordered to be closed.[28][106]
The Scottish Parliament closed on 24 March, with plans to reconvene on 1 April to discuss emergency legislation.[107] The UK Parliament closed on 25 March.[108]
On 24 March, it was announced that NHS England would establish a temporary critical care hospital, NHS Nightingale Hospital London, in the Excel London conference centre.[109] Also on 24 March, it was reported that NHS Wales were looking at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff for a similar purpose.[110] On 25 March, it was confirmed that NHS Scotland had identified Glasgow's SEC Centre exhibition and conference facility as a potential site for a similar hospital in Scotland.[111] On 26 March it was reported that the Northern Ireland health service was also looking for potential sites to use for temporary hospitals.[112] On 27 March, NHS England announced that they would be establishing more NHS Nightingale Hospitals in major conference centres to help to deal with the large number of cases expected.[113]
According to official data released on 24 March, there had been 87 new coronavirus deaths in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths to 422.[114]
On 25 March, British diplomat Steven Dick, deputy ambassador to Hungary, died in Budapest after contracting the virus.[115] On the same day, it was announced the police would be given the power to use "reasonable force" to enforce the regulations.[116] The first two working NHS doctors died from COVID-19 on the same day, one a GP, the other a surgeon.[117]
On 26 March, the number of UK coronavirus deaths jumped by more than 100 in a day for the first time, rising to 578, while a total of 11,568 had tested positive for the virus.[118] At 8pm that day, people from across the UK took part in national applause in appreciation of health workers.[119] This applause was repeated the following week.[120]

On 28 March, the Scottish Secretary Alister Jack announced that he was self-isolating after experiencing coronavirus symptoms.[129] A further 260 deaths also took the number of fatalities past 1,000, with a total of 1,019 deaths having occurred so far, and 17,089 people having tested positive.[130] That evening, new regulations came into force in Northern Ireland giving authorities the power to force businesses to close, and impose fines on them if they refused, as well as on people leaving their homes without a "reasonable excuse". The measures, introduced by the Northern Ireland Executive, brought Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the UK.[131][132]

Social distancing while queueing to enter a British supermarket 30 March 2020
On 29 March it was reported that the government would send a letter to 30 million households warning that things would "get worse before they get better" and that tighter restrictions could be implemented if necessary. The letter would also be accompanied by a leaflet setting out the government's lockdown rules along with health information.[133] Speaking at the government's daily briefing later that day, Dr Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, suggested it could be six months before life could return to "normal", because social distancing measures would have to be reduced "gradually".[134] The first NHS nurse died of COVID-19.[117]
On 30 March, Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minister's Chief Adviser, was reported to be self-isolating after experiencing coronavirus symptoms.[135] As the number of reported deaths rose to 1,408, Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser said that there were early signs social distancing measures were "making a difference". Transmission of the virus within the community was thought to be decreasing, and hospital admission data suggested cases were not rising as fast as anticipated.[136] At the same briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced an arrangement between the government and major UK airlines to fly home tens of thousands of British nationals who had been stranded abroad by the coronavirus outbreak.[137]
On 31 March the largest UK death toll of the outbreak so far was reported, with 381 deaths taking the total to 1,789.[138] Matthew Gould, chief executive of NHSX, the government body responsible for policy regarding technology in the NHS, said the organisation was looking seriously at a coronavirus app that would alert people if they had recently been in contact with someone testing positive for the virus after scientists advising the government suggested it "could play a critical role" in limiting lockdowns.[139]

On 1 April the government confirmed that a total of 2,000 NHS staff had been tested for coronavirus since the outbreak began, but Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said a shortage of chemicals needed for the test meant it was not possible to screen the NHS's 1.2 million workforce.[140] Gove's statement was contradicted by the Chemical Industries Association, which said there was not a shortage of the relevant chemicals and that at a meeting with a business minister the week before the government had not tried to find out about potential supply problems.[141] On 1 April the number of deaths was confirmed to have increased by 563 to 2,362, while a total of 29,474 cases had been diagnosed, 4,324 over the previous 24 hours.[140]
On 2 April, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced a "five pillar" plan for testing people for the virus, with the aim of conducting 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. Hancock was speaking at the daily government briefing after ending his seven-day period of isolation.[142] At 8pm on 2 April the UK gave another national round of applause for NHS staff and other key workers.[143]
With warm weather forecast for some areas during the upcoming weekend, on 3 April Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned people to stay at home, telling them this was an instruction "not a request".[144] On 4 April it was announced that a five-year-old had died from the virus, believed to be the youngest victim to date.[145] The death total was reported as 4,313, having risen by 708 from the previous day's figure. At the government's daily press briefing, Michael Gove dismissed a conspiracy theory growing on social media about 5G spreading COVID-19, saying the theory is "just nonsense, dangerous nonsense as well", after several telecommunications masts were vandalised and torched. Vodafone, the world's second largest mobiler operator, said the attacks were now a matter of national security.[146][145]
On 5 April, the Queen made a rare broadcast to the UK and the wider Commonwealth, something she has done on only four previous occasions. In the address she thanked people for following the government's social distancing rules and paid tribute to key workers, and said the UK "will succeed" in its fight against coronavirus but may have "more still to endure".[147] Later that evening it was announced that the Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, had been admitted to hospital as a "precautionary measure" after suffering from symptoms for more than a week with no improvement.[148] Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland's chief medical officer, resigned from her post after it emerged she had been spoken to by police for visiting her second home during lockdown.[149]
Testing and surveillance

Warning notices at a London doctor's surgery, 13 March 2020
Shortly after confirming that the cause of the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan was a new coronavirus, Chinese authorities had shared its genetic sequence for international developments of diagnostic kits.[36] The UK subsequently developed a prototype specific laboratory test for the new disease, performed on a sample from the nose, throat, and respiratory tract and tested at PHE's Colindale laboratories in London.[49] By 3 February 326 tests had been performed in the UK.[13] Over the following few weeks, PHE made the test available to 12 other laboratories in the UK, making it possible to test 1,000 people a day.[49]
Following 300 staff being asked to work from home on 26 February 2020 in London, while a suspected person was awaiting a test result for the virus, PHE announced it was to increase surveillance by widening testing around the UK to include people with flu-like symptoms at 100 GP surgeries and eight hospitals: the Royal Brompton and Harefield, Guy's and St Thomas' and Addenbrookes Hospital, as well as hospitals at Brighton and Sussex, Nottingham, South Manchester, Sheffield, Leicester.[150][151] Surveillance was shortly extended to some hospitals and GP surgeries in Scotland.[58]
Drive-through screening centres were set up by Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust at Parsons Green Health Centre on 24 February 2020,[14] and by NHS Lothian at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.[15] A further drive-through testing station was set up by the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust at a site just off the A57 Sheffield Parkway dual-carriageway on 10 March; in this case, patients ringing NHS 111 with coronavirus-like symptoms in the Sheffield area will be told to drive, if possible, to the testing centre at an allotted time.[152]
On 11 March NHS England announced that testing in NHS laboratories would increase from testing 1,500 to 10,000 per day.[67] The test consists of taking a sample from the nose, throat, deeper lung samples, blood or stool, and transporting the packed samples to the listed PHE regional laboratory designated for the referring laboratory region.[153][154] As of 12/13 March 2020, 29,764 tests had been conducted in the UK, corresponding to 450.8 tests per million people.[155] On 24 March, Matt Hancock said the government had bought 3.5m kits that would test if a person has already had COVID-19; no date was given for their arrival. These tests would allow people to know if they were immune and therefore able to "go back to work".[156] Hancock announced on 28 March that 10,000 tests a day were now being processed; the actual figure was 5,000.[157][158] As of 31 March, 143,186 people had been tested.[159]
The government and Public Health England were criticised for what some saw as a failure to organise mass testing. On 28 March the editor-in-chief of The Lancet published a condemnation of what he saw as government inaction and ignoring of WHO advice.[160] On 31 March former WHO director Anthony Costello, following WHO advice that countries should "test, test, test", said the key to the UK transitioning out of lockdown was mass testing, and that the UK had the capacity to reach the level of testing being carried out by Germany (70,000 tests a day, compared to the UK's 5,000), but that the government and Public Health England (PHE) had been too slow and controlling to organise.[161] The day after, Conservative MP Jeremy Hunt, chair of the Health and Social Care Select Committee and former Health Secretary, said it was "very worrying" that the government had not introduced mass testing because doing so had been "internationally proven as the most effective way of breaking the chain of transmission".[162]
Forecasting

Social distancing at a London pharmacy, 23 March 2020
Reports from the Medical Research Council's Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London have been providing mathematically calculated estimates of cases and case fatality rates.[49][163] In February, the team at Imperial, led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, estimated about two-thirds of cases in travellers from China were not detected and that some of these may have begun "chains of transmission within the countries they entered."[164][165][166] They forecast that the new coronavirus could infect up to 60% of the UK's population, in the worst-case scenario.[167]
In a paper, the Imperial team provided detailed forecasts of the potential impacts of the epidemic in the UK and US.[25][168] It details the potential outcomes of an array of 'non-pharmaceutical interventions'. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.[25] On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.[23][168] A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.[169]
In April, biostatistician Professor Sheila Bird said that delays in the reporting of deaths from the virus mean that there is a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend.[170]

On 16 March, the BBC delayed the implementation of its planned changes to TV licences for those aged over 75 from June to August.[189] On 25 March the BBC also announced that it would delay its plans to cut 450 news jobs due to the pressure of covering the pandemic.[190]
On 17 March, the BBC announced major changes to the schedule across the network. While programmes such as Politics Live, Victoria Derbyshire, The Andrew Neil Show, Newswatch, The Travel Show and HARDtalk were suspended, others such as Newsnight and The Andrew Marr Show would continue with a smaller number of production staff. Question Time would be moved to an earlier timeslot and be broadcast without an audience from a fixed location. Podcast programmes Americast, Beyond Today and The Next Episode were also suspended.[191] On 18 March it was announced that filming on the sets of Casualty, Doctors, EastEnders, Holby City, Pobol y Cwm and River City would be suspended. The broadcaster additionally announced that the number of weekly episodes of EastEnders would be reduced to ensure that it remained on screen for as long as possible.[186] The BBC also said that it would show more educational programmes to cater for children not attending school, and that it was in talks with the Department for Education and schools to support GCSE and A Level curriculums with extra programmes on BBC Four and the BBC Red Button service.[192] The BBC would also broadcast more programmes focused on health, fitness, education, religion and food recipes, while both the BBC and ITV would produce a weekly prime-time programme giving the public information about the coronavirus pandemic.[188] On the same day the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest, scheduled to be held in Rotterdam in May, was also cancelled.[193] On 22 March, ITV announced that its daytime programmes Lorraine and Loose Women would cease live broadcasting from the following day.[187]
On radio the BBC World Service programmes The World This Week, World Update and Weekend were all suspended.

Consumers

The almost empty pasta section in a London Tesco, 7 March 2020
It was reported in The Guardian that British supermarkets and their suppliers had developed a plan to ensure a consistent supply of a range of basic goods if there was panic-buying by consumers. Tesco, the country's largest supermarket chain, was said to have carried out simulation exercises to plan for events such as a pandemic flu outbreak which could be used to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.[21] There were reports of hand sanitiser and anti-bacterial products selling out at some supermarkets.[197] Online retailers reported consumers placing unusually large orders while the managing director of the frozen food chain Iceland reported increased sales of "multibuy deals and larger packs".[21]

People in London were buying more canned foods and toilet paper, 18 March 2020
Some supermarkets and other shops responded by limiting the quantity of popular items that each customer could buy, while others had a limit across their entire range.[198][199] Sainsbury's announced on 18 March that they would introduce a dedicated shopping hour for elderly and disabled customers, as well as giving them priority for online deliveries.[200] Other supermarkets, such as Iceland and Morrisons, also introduced measures.[201] Sainsbury's further announced on 21 March that they would give healthcare workers allocated shopping hours on three mornings a week.[202]
Amazon stopped sellers from sending non-essential products to their warehouses.[203] Selfridges closed all its stores and sold only online.[203]
In response to the panic buying of food, Professor Stephen Powis, medical director at NHS England, said on 21 March that NHS staff were being deprived of food supplies because of the activities of some consumers, and urged people to shop responsibly. Helen Dickinson, head of the British Retail Consortium said that there was enough food in the supply chain, but that the issue was getting it to retailers quick enough, suggesting the food industry was experiencing "a peak in demand" like at Christmas, but "without the four-month build-up period." She added that that an extra £1bn had been spent on food in the preceding three weeks.[204] Environment Secretary George Eustice also urged shoppers to stop panic buying.[205] On the same day it was reported that Tesco, Asda, Aldi, and Lidl had begun a recruitment drive for up to 30,000 new staff.[206]
On 21 March, the government announced that the 5p charge for carrier bags would be waived for online food deliveries.[207]
Sainsbury's announced that it would remove purchasing limits on most items from 5 April.[208]
Defence
Main articles: Military aid to the civil authorities, Operation Rescript, and Operation Broadshare
In March 2020, the Ministry of Defence announced the formation of the COVID Support Force, a 20,000 strong military support force to support public services and civil authorities in tackling the virus.[96] Two military operations; Operation Rescript, based in the UK, and Operation Broadshare, focused on overseas defence activities, were launched.[97] 150 military personnel began receiving training to drive oxygen tankers for the NHS.[96] The Telegraph reported Chief of the Defence Staff Nick Carter had ordered the military to prepare for a "six month" operation.[209] The armed forces had already been used to assist the government in bringing British citizens home from affected areas, including China and Japan.[210] On 22 March, the Royal Air Force reportedly assisted repatriation flights of British and EU citizens from Cuba.[211] The Guardian reported that training exercises, including those overseas in Canada and Kenya, had been cancelled to free up personnel for the COVID Support Force.[212] Several air shows, including the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford, were also cancelled.[213]
The Royal Air Force began using Birmingham Airport to practise transferring Coronavirus patients to local hospitals via helicopter.[214][215] A critically ill patient was also transported from the Gilbert Bain Hospital in Shetland to an intensive care ward in Aberdeen by an RAF Airbus A400M Atlas aircraft.[216]
On 24 March 2020, it was announced that military planners helped plan a temporary hospital to be opened in the ExCeL London conference centre, to be named the NHS Nightingale Hospital, which would be staffed by military medics, alongside the NHS.[217]
Economics
The governor of the Bank of England called on the British government to provide support to businesses affected by the virus[218] and was reported to be working with the Treasury to provide a stimulus package to prevent the British economy falling into recession.[219] Companies listed on the London stock markets have fallen in value with commentators citing worries about the virus.[220] To stimulate the economy, the Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.75 to 0.25 percent.[221] On 19 March, the interest rate was again cut this time to 0.10% – the lowest rate in the bank's 325-year existence.[222] On 28 March, Fitch downgraded the UK's government debt rating from AA to AA-, because of coronavirus borrowing, economic decline, and lingering uncertainty over Brexit. The ratings agency believes that the UK's government deficit for 2020 might equal 9% of GDP, compared to 2% the previous year.[223]
Education
Following cases in Italy, the Cransley School in Northwich, Cheshire, and Trinity Catholic College in Middlesbrough closed, as some of their pupils had returned with symptoms from Italy. Fourteen schools in England had closed by 28 February.[19] Loughborough University reported a student confirmed to have the virus after recent travel to Italy, and indicated that several staff members and students began self-isolation.[224]
Cambridge University was heavily criticised for their incoherent response to the pandemic which forced international students and staff to scramble to make arrangements to return home with only two days' notice. On 13 March, students and staff were advised that international travel was discouraged and university facilities would stay open at reduced capacity. However, on 18 March, Vice Chancellor Stephen Toope announced a sudden U-turn and all university buildings would be indefinitely shut from all staff and students from the afternoon of Friday 20 March onwards, and all students are strongly encouraged to leave Cambridge.[225] The president of Cambridge UCU criticised that this sudden shutdown will exacerbate the pandemic as students from countries with weaker healthcare provisions are forced to return home.[225] Over a thousand Cambridge students signed an open letter requesting to have multiple assessment options in lieu of the cancelled examinations in Cambridge, including the option to retake part or all of the academic year in 2020–21.[226]
Coventry University first suspended all graduation ceremonies due to be held in March and April,[227] and from 20 March, suspended all face-to-face teaching, in favour of on-line delivery.[228] Many other higher education institutions took similar steps at around the same time.[229]
On 18 March, the Welsh government announced that all schools in Wales would be closing by 20 March.[230] On the same day, the First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon announced that Scottish schools would also be closing from 20 March, and may not reopen before the summer.[231] Later that day, it was announced that schools in Northern Ireland would close to pupils immediately and to staff on 20 March.[232] Shortly thereafter, the Secretary of State for Education, Gavin Williamson announced that schools in England would close from 20 March for an unspecified length of time.[233] Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, however, that schools will still look after the children of key workers, and vulnerable children.[234] The UK government also announced that GCSE and A Level exams were to be cancelled, an unprecedented action in UK educational history, and that grades were to be given out based on predicted grades and teacher assessment.[234][235][236]
Engineering
The seven Formula One motor racing based in the UK - McLaren, Mercedes, Racing Point, Red Bull, Renault and Williams - and Haas with its European headquarters there, are collaborating, in an initiative called "Project Pitlane", to develop and manufacture ventilators for hospitals to use for Covid-19 patients.[237][238]
Heavy equipment manufacturer JCB have created prototypes of housings for ventilators to be produced by technology company Dyson, and is planning to start producing them to help Dyson fulfil a government order placed with them for 10,000 machines.[239]
On 2 April, it was announced that Ineos, the UK chemical company, had set up a factory capable of producing 1 million bottles of hand sanitiser per month. The factory in Newton Aycliffe, which usually produces PVC products for windows, is operating on three shifts per day and is distributing free bottles of sanitiser to the UK's national health services.[240]
Events
LGBT pride
On 23 March, Pride in London, the UK's largest LGBT Pride festival, scheduled for 27 June, was postponed. It was one of a hundred pride events to be postponed or cancelled in the UK.[241] On 3 April, Brighton Pride, scheduled for Saturday 1 August, was cancelled.[242]
Food and hospitality
Fast food and drink outlets Pret a Manger and McDonald's[243] (among others) at first announced that they would not permit customers to sit and eat in stores, but customers could still order products to take away and consume off the premises. On 22 March McDonald's announced it would close all outlets in the UK and Ireland by 7pm on 23 March.[244] Nando's announced later the same day they would also close their outlets.[244]
Initially, the pub chain J D Wetherspoon remained open, despite government advice for the public to avoid places of social activity, including pubs. The chain announced that it would keep all pubs open "unless the government states otherwise"[245] On 20 March, all Wetherspoon pubs were closed in line with instructions from the government.[246]
Government

Guidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.[44] In February, Chief Medical Adviser to the UK Government, Chris Whitty explained "we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain; the second of these is to delay; the third of these is to do the science and the research; and the fourth is to mitigate so we can brace the NHS."[16] These aims equate to four phases; specific actions involved in each of these phases are:
Contain: detect early cases, follow up close contacts, and prevent the disease taking hold in this country for as long as is reasonably possible
Delay: slow the spread within the UK, and (if it does take hold) lower the peak impact and push it away from the winter season
Research: better understand the virus and the actions that will lessen its effect on the UK population; innovate responses including diagnostics, drugs and vaccines; use the evidence to inform the development of the most effective models of care
Mitigate: provide the best care possible for people who become ill, support hospitals to maintain essential services and ensure ongoing support for people ill in the community, to minimise the overall impact of the disease on society, public services and on the economy.[248]
The four UK CMOs raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January 2020, upon the World Health Organization's announcement of the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.[12][13] As soon as cases appeared in the UK on 31 January 2020, a public health information campaign, similar to the previous "Catch it, Bin it, Kill it" campaign, was launched in the UK, to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus.[13] Travellers from Hubei province in China, including the capital Wuhan were advised to self-isolate, "stay at home, not go to work, school or public places, not use public transport or taxis, ask friends, family members or delivery services to do errands",[249] and call NHS 111 if they had arrived in the UK in previous 14 days, regardless of whether they were unwell or not.[13] Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to announce the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020.[12] Daily updates have been published by the DHSC.[12] NHS Digital in the meanwhile, have been collecting data.[250]

Poster for the "Catch it, Bin it, Kill it" slogan which has been revived in the fight against coronavirus
On 25 February 2020, the UK's CMOs advice for all travellers (unwell or not) who had returned to the UK from Hubei province in the previous 14 days, Iran, specific areas designated by the Italian government as quarantine areas in northern Italy and special care zones in South Korea since 19 February, to self-isolate and call NHS 111.[46] This advice was also advocated for any person who has flu-like symptoms with a history of travelling from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and areas in Italy north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini, returning to the UK since 19 February. Later, self-isolation was recommended for anyone returning from any part of Italy from 9 March.[12][46]
Initially Prime Minister Boris Johnson largely kept Britain open, resisting the kind of lockdowns seen elsewhere in Europe. On Friday 13 March, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told BBC Radio 4 that one of "the key things we need to do" is to "build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission".[251] This involves enough people getting infected, upon which they develop immunity to the disease.[252][253] Vallance said that 60% of the UK's population will need to become infected for herd immunity to be achieved.[254][253] This stance was criticised by experts who said that it would lead to hundreds of thousands deaths and overwhelm the NHS. Over 200 scientists urged the government to rethink the approach in an open letter.[255] Subsequently, Health Secretary Matt Hancock denied that herd immunity was a plan for the UK, although the Department of Health and Social Care said that "herd immunity is a natural byproduct of an epidemic".[256] There was also criticism over a lack of transparency around the scientific evidence being used to inform the government response, with a letter published in the Lancet on 17 March calling on the government to openly share its data and models as a matter of urgency.[257]
On 2 March, Boris Johnson said in an interview with BBC News: "The most important thing now is that we prepare against a possible very significant expansion of coronavirus in the UK population". This came after the 39th case in the UK was confirmed and over a month after the first confirmed case in the UK.[258] The same day, a BBC One programme Coronavirus: Everything You Need to Know addressed questions from the public on the outbreak.[259] The following day, the Coronavirus Action Plan was unveiled.[12] The next day, as the total number of cases in the UK stood at 51, the government declared the coronavirus pandemic as a "level 4 incident",[18] permitting NHS England to take command of all NHS resources.[18][260] Planning has been made for behaviour changing publicity including good hygiene and respiratory hygiene ("catch it, bin it, kill it"),[261] a simple measure which helps in delaying the peak of the infection and buys time for the testing of drugs and initial development of vaccines.[248] Primary care has been issued guidance.[262]
Controversy over apparent errors that the Government had made continued. For example, Dr. Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet told BBC's Question Time that "We knew in the last week of January that this was coming. The message from China was absolutely clear that a new virus with pandemic potential was hitting cities. ... We knew that 11 weeks ago and then we wasted February when we could have acted."[263]
Public Health England has also been involved with efforts to support the British Overseas Territories against the outbreak.[264][265]
On 27 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed he had contracted coronavirus and self-isolated, however he stated he would continue to lead the Government's response to coronavirus through video conference.[121] On the evening of 5 April the Prime Minister was admitted to hospital for tests.[266]
Regulations and legislation
The government published the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020[267] on 10 February 2020, a statutory instrument covering the legal framework behind the government's initial containment and isolation strategies and its organisation of the national reaction to the virus. Other published regulations include changes to Statutory Sick Pay (into force on 13 March),[268] and changes to Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit (also 13 March).[269]
On 19 March, the government introduced the Coronavirus Act 2020, which grants the government discretionary emergency powers in the areas of the NHS, social care, schools, police, the Border Force, local councils, funerals and courts.[270] The act received royal assent on 25 March 2020.[271]
Closures to pubs, restaurants and indoor sports and leisure facilities were imposed via the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Business Closure) (England) Regulations 2020.[272]
The restrictions on movements, except for allowed purposes are:
Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020[273]
Health Protection (Coronavirus) (Restrictions) (Scotland) Regulations 2020[274]
Health Protection (Coronavirus Restrictions) (Wales) Regulations 2020[275]
The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020[276]
Communications

UK Government advisory SMS message, 24 March 2020
The government has held daily evening press conferences since the 17 March. These were mostly hosted by Boris Johnson with cabinet ministers (often Matt Hancock) and senior scientific advisors.[277]
On 24 March, all major mobile telephony providers, acting upon a government request, sent out an SMS message to each of their customers, with advice on staying isolated.[278] This was the first ever use of the facility.[278] Although the government in 2013 endorsed the use of Cell Broadcast to send official emergency messages to all mobile phones, and has tested such a system, it has never actually been implemented. Backer Toby Harris said that the government had not yet agreed upon who would fund and govern such a system.[279][280]
Law and order
On 17 March trials lasting longer than three days were postponed until May in England and Wales, while Scottish courts were not starting any new trial indefinitely. In England and Wales those cases already running would continue in the hope of reaching a conclusion.[281][282] A poll published on 20 March claimed that only 23% of British adults were strictly following the government's coronavirus advice.[283]
Personal attacks
Further information: List of incidents of xenophobia and racism related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic § United Kingdom
There have been reports of hate incidents against Italian and Chinese persons[284] and a Singaporean student was assaulted in London in an attack that police linked to coronavirus fears.[285]
Prisons
The government released specific guidance to prisons in the event of coronavirus symptoms or cases, specifically the rule that "any prisoner or detainee with a new, continuous cough or a high temperature should be placed in protective isolation for 7 days".[286] There are around 83,000 prisoners in England and Wales.[287]
On 14 March, a prison officer in HMP High Down in Surrey tested positive for the virus and was sent home to self-isolate. Four officers who had contact with him were placed in isolation as a precaution.[288] On 18 March, the first coronavirus case was reported within the UK prison population. The prisoner, who had been serving time in HMP Manchester (commonly referred to as Strangeways), was moved to a hospital. While no other prisoners or staff tested positive for the virus, thirteen prisoners and four members of staff were put into isolation as a precaution.[289] Prison visits remained open, but the situation is being monitored.[290] On 19 March, it was revealed that around 75 officers at HMP Berwyn in Wales were off work due to sickness or self-isolation, and 22 prisoners showing symptoms of coronavirus were being isolated by the prison. However, the prison had enough staff members to remain fully operational.[291] Another prison officer tested positive on 20 March at HMP Whitemoor near March, Cambridgeshire.[292]
Following the case in HMP Manchester, public services think tank Reform called for the release of 2,305 "low-risk" offenders on short sentences to reduce the risk of coronavirus on the prison population.[293] Their report argues that prison are "overcrowded [with] insanitary conditions and poor-quality healthcare".[294] Similar actions have been taken in Iran and the United States.[295] Former justice secretary David Gauke echoed similar sentiments, citing the "churn" of prisoners going in and out of prison as a risk.[296]
On 23 March, a prisoner tested positive for the virus at HMP Birmingham and was placed into isolation. The prison was not placed into full lockdown, but made the decision to restrict access.[297] On the same day, a prisoner at HMP Oakwood near Wolverhampton tested positive for the virus and was placed into isolation. Visits to the prison were not stopped, but it is believed they were reduced.[298]
On 24 March, the Ministry of Justice announced that prison visits would be suspended and that inmates would be confined to their cells.[299] In order to maintain communication between prisoners and their families, the government promised 900 secure phones to 55 prisons, with calls being monitored and time-limited.[300] In a committee meeting on the same day, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland suggested that 50 pregnant inmates might be given early release, and another 9,000 inmates awaiting trial could be transferred to bail hostels.[301]
On 26 March, it was reported that 84-year-old convicted paedophile Edwin Hillier had died from COVID-19 on 22 March at HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire,[302] becoming the first inmate in the UK to die from the virus. Another 66-year-old male inmate died from COVID-19 on 26 March at HMP Manchester.[303] As of 1pm the previous day, there were 19 confirmed cases in the prison population across 10 prisons.[287]
Immigration centres
During mid-March, 300 people were released from immigration detention centres because of the pandemic following a campaign by charities concerned with an outbreak of COVID-19 in the centres.[304] On 25 March, it was reported that three immigration detention centres had reported cases of people with coronavirus.[305] On 2 April, a letter leaked from G4S, a company running immigration detention centres for the Home Office, revealed that detainees who were at high risk from COVID-19 were being put in solitary confinement.[306]
Policing
On 26 March, in an attempt to emphasise the importance of following the social distancing instructions given by the government, the police were given powers to impose fines on individuals gathered in groups or who refuse to return home when asked to.[307] By 31 March, some police forces, and individual officers, were being criticised by a variety of people - citizens,[308] former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption,[307][309] former justice secretary David Gauke,[308] former chancellor George Osborne,[310] privacy and civil liberties group Big Brother Watch[308] - for over-zealous and incorrect application of the new powers. Police had stopped people from buying Easter eggs, put black dye into Harpur Hill Quarry, and, using a drone, filmed people before posting the images on social media.[310] New guidance was released by the National Police Chiefs Council.[311]
National health services
Appointments and self-isolation

A Coronavirus 'pod' at Hull Royal Infirmary.
In March, hospitals in England begin to prepare for the cancellation of all non-urgent elective procedures.[312] On 22 March, the government announced that it would be asking about 1.5 million people (everyone in England with certain health conditions that carry serious risk if infected) to self-isolate for 12 weeks. They were to be notified by mail or text messaged by their NHS general practitioners, and provided deliveries of medication, food, and household essentials, delivered by pharmacists and local governments, and at least initially paid for by the UK government.[313] Members of the public were told to stay at home, should they suspect they have symptoms of covid-19, and not visit a GP, pharmacy, or hospital.[314] For advice, the public were told to use a dedicated online self-assessment form before calling NHS 111, the non-emergency medical helpline.[315]
Equipment

Face masks given to NHS staff March 2020
On 16 March Boris Johnson met with business leaders via conference call and set them the target of delivering 30,000 ventilators in a fortnight; the government also declined to join an emergency European Union scheme to procure ventilators and other emergency equipment like personal protective equipment (PPE) for hospital staff, stating that the UK was no longer part of the EU and that this was area in which it was making its own efforts.[316] On 21 March, it was announced that NHS England had negotiated a deal to use, at cost price, almost the entire private health system, bringing 8,000 beds and 1,100 ventilators into the project.[317] Existing ventilator stocks stood at 5,900 at the beginning of the outbreak.[318]
On 16 March primary care magazine Pulse reported doctors were receiving out of date PPE that had had its 2016 use-by date covered with a sticker saying "2021".[319] In response, the government offered reassurance that this was safe.[320] Earlier in the month, in response to a survey of Pulse's readership, two of five GPs reported they still did not have PPE to protect them from coronavirus.[319] Some of these concerns were raised with Johnson during Prime Minister's Questions, to which the Prime Minister replied the UK had "stockpiles" of PPE.[321] The same day, the Doctors' Association reported NHS staff felt they were being put at risk due to lack of PPE.[322] On 22 March, in a letter with 3,963 signatures published in The Times, NHS staff asked Johnson to "protect the lives of the life-savers" and resolve the what they saw as the "unacceptable" shortage of protective equipment.[323][324] On 23 March, in an effort to meet demand and due to concerns about the rising number of medics becoming ill after exposure to the virus, the NHS asked DIY stores to donate PPE for use by NHS staff.[325] Hancock admitted there were "challenges" with supplying PPE to NHS staff and said a million masks had been bought that weekend.[326] The following day, the government said there was enough PPE for everyone in the NHS who needed it; this was contradicted by the Royal College of Nursing,[327] and the British Medical Association (BMA), which said some of the PPE doctors had received were inadequate[328] and medics were resorting to wearing DIY PPE they had purchased themselves.[329] The BMA warned that without enough PPE doctors would die.[330]

People in London wear masks on 19 March 2020
On March 31, 10,000 health workers wrote to the prime minister demanding better safeguards, including the right PPE.[331] On 1 April, the government said 390 million pieces of PPE had been distributed to the health service in the past fortnight. The Royal College of Midwives[332] and the BMA said that the supplies had yet to reach medical staff.[333] The RCM, in a joint statement with unions, including Unite, Unison and the GMB, said the lack of PPE was now 'a crisis within a crisis'.[332]
On 29 March the government issued specification for the "minimally clinically acceptable" manufacturer and use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machines.[334]
Staffing
On 1 March, Hancock said retired NHS staff might be asked to return to work to help with the crisis.[335] The request was issued on 19 March and included final year medical students.[336] On 29 March, Boris Johnson announced that more than 20,000 former NHS staff were returning to work in response to the pandemic.[337]
On 21 March, it was announced that the NHS had negotiated a deal to use, at cost price, almost the entire private health system, bringing 20,000 medical staff into the national effort.[317]
On 24 March, Matt Hancock announced the start of a scheme to recruit 250,000 volunteers to support the NHS through the pandemic.[338] The volunteers would carry out jobs like collecting and deliver shopping, medication or "other essential supplies" for people in isolation; transporting equipment and medication between NHS services; transporting medically fit patients and providing telephone support to people at risk of loneliness because of self-isolation.[339] The target was surpassed in 24 hours and was raised to 750,000.[340] The scheme was paused on 29 March after the new target was reached.[339]
Beds
The National Health Service freed up 30,000 beds by discharging patients who were well enough and delaying non-emergency treatment,[341] and acquired use of 20,000 beds in private sector facilities.[341] Emergency building work was undertaken to add capacity to existing hospitals, 52 beds in Wigan, for example.[342]

On 24 March, it was announced that NHS England would establish a temporary critical care hospital, NHS Nightingale Hospital London, in the Excel London conference centre.[109] The field hospital would have 4,000 beds in two wards.[343][344] Also on 24 March, it was reported that NHS Wales were looking at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff for a similar purpose.[110] On 25 March, it was confirmed that NHS Scotland had identified Glasgow's SEC Centre exhibition and conference facility as a potential site for a similar hospital in Scotland.[111] On 26 March it was reported that the Northern Ireland health service was also looking for potential sites to use for temporary hospitals.[112] On 27 March, NHS England announced that they would be establishing more NHS Nightingale Hospitals in other major UK conference centres to help to deal with the large number of cases expected,[113] at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham and at Manchester Central Convention Complex.[345] The London hospital opened 3 April.[346]

The chief rabbi in the United Kingdom advised the suspension of Jewish worship in synagogues and the Muslim Council of Britain has ordered the closure of mosques in the country.[351]
Sport
On 5 March, the England–Italy fixtures in the men's and women's' Six Nations Championship tournaments, set to be played in Rome on 14 and 15 March, were postponed by tournament organisers after the Italian government introduced restrictions on attendances to sporting events.[353] Scotland's Women's Six Nations home fixture against France on 7 March was also postponed after one Scotland player tested positive for the virus.[354]
To contain the spread of the virus the Premier League announced on 6 March an end to pre-match fair play handshakes between players and officials.[355] On 10 March, the Premier League match between Manchester City and Arsenal was postponed in light of confirmation that Nottingham Forest and Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis had contracted the virus. Marinakis had met with several Arsenal players when the London side hosted Olympiacos in a Europa League round of 32 match.[356] On 10 March the four-day Cheltenham Festival continued as planned with enhanced hygiene measures in place,[357] as did the All England Open Badminton Championships in Birmingham the next day.[358]
On 12 March, it was announced that Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta had tested positive to COVID-19,[359] and the next day Chelsea midfielder Callum Hudson-Odoi became the first Premier League player to test positive for coronavirus.[360] Professional football was later suspended across the United Kingdom on 13 March, with the Premier League, English Football League, Women's Super League, and Welsh and Northern Irish football leagues delaying matches until the beginning of April[361] and the Scottish Professional Football League suspending matches indefinitely.[362] Professional football in England was later postponed until the end of April.[363] The day also saw the cancellation of the Wales–Scotland Six Nations match scheduled for 14 March[364] and the postponement of the London, Manchester and Brighton Marathons from their April dates until the autumn.[365]
The next five days saw a flurry of further sporting cancellations. Five fixtures set to be played on Saturday 14 March in the National League were postponed,[366] with all matches across both the National League and the Northern Premier League suspended two days later and the Football Association recommending the postponement of grassroots level football "for the foreseeable future".[367] The Welsh Rugby Union discontinued all rugby matches across Wales from Saturday evening until the end of the month.[368] On Sunday 15 March the Netball Superleague was postponed.[369] Premiership Rugby was suspended for five weeks on Monday 16 March, with all rugby activities in England being delayed until 14 April.[370] Monday additionally saw the cancellation of the Grand National,[371] the postponement of the Edinburgh Marathon from May to September,[372] and the first peacetime cancellation of the Boat Race.[373] On Tuesday 17 March all motor racing events sanctioned by the national governing body Motorsport UK were suspended until May.[374] All horse racing events were similarly suspended the following day,[371] as were all boxing tournaments until further notice subject to a British Boxing Board of Control review in April.[375]
Royal family
On 4 March, the 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth II wore long gloves while awarding honours at a public investiture ceremony, prompting some to speculate the measure as a precaution against COVID-19.[376][377] On 19 March the Queen left London for Windsor Castle.[378] On the same day she issued a message to the nation noting that the country and the world was entering a period of great concern and uncertainty.[379] Her grandsons Princes William and Harry both sent messages out via social media.[380] Princess Beatrice cancelled her wedding reception at Buckingham Palace and took further advice on whether to carry on with a private wedding ceremony.[381]
On 9 March, Prince Charles greeted people with the Namaste hand gesture instead of a handshake at the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey to avoid the spread of the virus, and did the same for the Prince's Trust Awards on 11 March.[382] On 10 March, Charles met Prince Albert of Monaco, who later came down with the infection.[383] On 25 March, it was announced that he had received a positive test result for COVID-19 and was suffering mild symptoms. He self-isolated at Birkhall on the Balmoral Castle estate.[384][385] Concerns were raised for the health of the entire Royal Family, as well as concerns that he may have unwittingly become a super-spreader of the disease due to the vast number of people he regularly meets. Charles last saw the Queen on 12 March, just one day before the earliest date medical experts believe he would have been contagious.[383] The Duchess of Cornwall tested negative, but self-isolated with him.[384][385] On 30 March Clarence House, the Prince's official residence, confirmed that he had come out of self-isolation after seven days having recovered from the illness.[386][387]
On 29 March the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge gave their support to a Public Health England campaign to protect people's mental health during the outbreak. The campaign encourages people to stay in touch with family and friends via telephone and social media.[388]
Transport

Aviation
From the latter half of January, Heathrow Airport received additional clinical support and tightened surveillance of the three direct flights that it receives from Wuhan every week; each were to be met by a Port Health team.[36] Later, airlines including British Airways and Ryanair announced a number of flight cancellations for March.[20]
Regional airline Flybe had been brought to the brink of collapse following prior financial trouble earlier in the year. This, combined with decreased ticket sales as a result of the outbreak, caused the airline to stop ticket sales on 4 March 2020.[389][390] The company entered administration and ceased operations the following day.[391]
Despite some calls for a bailout, led mainly by Virgin Atlantic, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said that the government would only come into the picture as "a last resort".[392][393]
Public transport
On 20 March, Southeastern became the first train operating company to announce a reduced timetable, which would come into use from 23 March.[394] On that day the government announced emergency measures to safeguard the nation's rail network, with season ticket holders given refunds if working from home, and rail franchise agreements nationalised for at least six months to prevent train operating companies from collapsing.[395][396] From 30 March, open-access operator Hull Trains suspended all services.[397]
On 19 March, the Stagecoach Supertram light rail network in Sheffield announced that they would be switching to a modified Sunday service from 23 March until further notice.[398] Local bus operators First South Yorkshire and Stagecoach Yorkshire, which operate across the same area, announced that they would also be switching to a reduced timetable from 23 March.[399]
Transport for London (TfL) services were reduced in stages. All Night Overground and Night Tube services, as well as all services on the Waterloo & City line, were suspended from 20 March, and 40 tube stations were closed on the same day.[400] The Mayor of London and TfL urged people to only use public transport if absolutely essential, so that it could be used by critical workers.[401] The London Underground brought in new measures on 25 March to combat the spread of the virus, by slowing the flow of passengers onto platforms. Measures included the imposition of queuing at ticket gates and turning off some escalators.[402]
National Express suspended all its long-distance coach services from 6 April.[403]
Spread to other countries and territories
Sophie Grégoire Trudeau, the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, tested positive for COVID-19 upon her return from WE Day events in the UK; on 12 March 2020 the Trudeau family entered two weeks of self-isolation.[404] The first patient in Mauritius was a 59-year-old man who returned from the United Kingdom on 7 March 2020. When he arrived in Mauritius, the Mauritian had no symptoms.[405] Other cases of the novel coronavirus resulting from travel to the UK were subsequently reported in India,[406][407] and Nigeria.[408]
Statistics
The figures in the table below represent laboratory confirmed cases only; however, as indicated by the UK Government's Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, it is likely that other cases in the UK are not reflected in these figures (on 12 March 2020 there were 596 confirmed cases, but the total number of cases was estimated at 5,000–10,000).[69] Death statistics are presented daily, but there may be a delay between death and it entering official statistics so families can be informed first. The delay is usually just a few days, but can be over a week.[409][170]
Known locations of death are shown in brackets.
