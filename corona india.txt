This article is about epidemiology of 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in India. For the current quarantine, see 2020 coronavirus lockdown in India.



The first case of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in India was reported on 30 January 2020, originating from China. As of 6 April 2020, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare have confirmed a total of 4,067 cases, 292 recoveries (including 1 migration) and 109 deaths in the country.[5] Experts suggest the number of infections could be much higher as India's testing rates are among the lowest in the world.[8] The infection rate of COVID-19 in India is reported to be 1.7, significantly lower than in the worst affected countries.[9]
The outbreak has been declared an epidemic in more than a dozen states and union territories, where provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 have been invoked, and educational institutions and many commercial establishments have been shut down. India has suspended all tourist visas, as a majority of the confirmed cases were linked to other countries.[10]
On 22 March 2020, India observed a 14-hour voluntary public curfew at the instance of the prime minister Narendra Modi. The government followed it up with lockdowns in 75 districts where COVID cases had occurred as well as all major cities.[11][12] Further, on 24 March, the prime minister ordered a nationwide lockdown for 21 days, affecting the entire 1.3 billion population of India.[13]
The World Health Organisation chief executive director of health emergencies programme Michael Ryan said that India had "tremendous capacity" to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and, as the second most populous country, will have enormous impact on the world's ability to deal with it.[14] Other commentators worried about the economic devastation caused by the lockdown, which has huge effects on informal workers, micro and small enterprises, farmers and the self-employed, who are left with no livelihood in the absence of transportation and access to markets.[15] The lockdown was justified by the government and other agencies for being preemptive to prevent India from entering a higher stage which could make handling very difficult and cause even more losses thereafter.[16][17][neutrality is disputed]
According to a study at Shiv Nadar University, India could have witnessed a surge of 31,000 cases of disease between March 24 and April 14 without lockdown.[18]

State government response

State governments took various measures to contain the spread of the virus.
Testing and countermeasures
Testing
Summary of test results

The Union Health Ministry's war room and policy making team in New Delhi consists of the ministry's Emergency Medical Response Unit, the Central Surveillance Unit (IDSP), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and experts from three government hospitals.[164] They are part of policy decisions to decide how coronavirus should be tackled in the country.[164] A cluster-containment strategy is mainly being adopted, similar to how India contained previous epidemics, as well as "breaking the chain of transmission".[164][165][166] 15 labs across India led by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, are testing for the virus, with more labs being trained.[167] On 14 March 65 labs were named capable for testing for the virus (though as of 17 March not all are fully functional.[168][169][170]
On 14 March, scientists at the National Institute of Virology isolated a strain of the novel coronavirus. By doing so, India became the fifth country to successfully obtain a pure sample of the virus after China, Japan, Thailand and the US.[171] The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that isolation of the virus will help towards expediting the development of drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits in the country.[172] NIV has shared two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with GISAID.[173]
Initially, the labs tested samples only from those with a travel history to 12 countries designated as high-risk, or those who have come in contact with anyone testing positive for the coronavirus, or showing symptoms as per the government guidelines.[174][175] On 20 March, the government decided to also include all pneumonia cases, regardless of travel or contact history after the country saw a sharp increase in the number of cases.[176] The first and second confirmatory tests for the virus has been made free by the government.[177] As of 14 March, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) has tested around 5,900 samples from individuals across the country. The number of tests per million in the country was 5 as of 14 March. In comparison, it is 26 in US, 76 in Japan, 1,005 in Italy and 4,099 in South Korea.[169] There are concerns that testing for the virus in India is being inadequately conducted and the need for ramping up the scale of testing is a necessity to understand the real scope of the number of people affected.[178]
The Ministry of Health said that only 10 per cent of test capacity has been utilised per day as of 15 March,[177] claiming that the amount of tests were enough. However experts thought they were not, saying that community transmission may go undetected without adequate testing.[169] They also wanted to add more testing centres by inclusion of private laboratories.[169][175] In mid-March the government authorised accredited private labs to test for the virus.[179]
Testing for community transmission began on 15 March. 65 laboratories of the Department of Health Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research (DHR-ICMR) have started testing random samples of people who exhibit flu-like symptoms and samples from patients without any travel history or contact with infected persons.[180][181] As of 18 March, no evidence of community transmission was found after results of 500 random samples tested negative.[182]
On 17 March, The Union Ministry of Health has decided to allow private pathology labs to test for COVID-19. The ministry official said that only the government lab is allowed to test the coronavirus. By allowing private labs, the work of testing can be doubled. The ministry said that about 60 private labs may soon be allowed for this.[183] Once set up, a person can get COVID-19 test done at a private lab after a qualified physician in a government facility recommends it.[184] The ICMR has appealed to the private labs to offer the tests for free as the government labs do.[183]
On 18 March, A top health ministry official said that a Swiss private company named Roche Diagnostics has been given the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency approval to conduct tests for coronavirus. The Indian regulator has given them a licence to conduct diagnostic tests of the virus on 17 March.[185] The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) was assessing giving another firm license while two Indian diagnostic companies have also sought approval for the coronavirus testing kits developed by them.[186] The government has also issued guidelines to cap the cost of sample testing by private labs at ₹4,500.[187]
On 19 March, Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy stated that India could be facing a "tsunami of cases within a few weeks" as testing increases and the reason for the low number of confirmed cases currently is due to under-testing. He also said that according to mathematical models applied in the US or UK at least 20%-60% of the population will be affected. Applying the same models in India means that at the lower end of the estimate there could be 300 million cases of which 4-8 million could be severe.[188]
111 additional labs for testing became functional on 21 March.[189]
On 24 March, Pune-based molecular diagnostic company Mylab Discovery Solutions became the first Indian company to have received validation for its RT-PCR tests from National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The test takes 2.5 hours and the company is looking to price it at around ₹1,200 (US$17), or Rs 80,000 for a 100 test kit.[190][191]
Till April, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology of Delhi had developed low cost paper-strip test that could detect COVID within an hour. Each test would cost ₹500 (US$7.00) and method could fulfill India's rapid need of testing.[192]
According to ICMR, 89,534 samples have been tested as of 5 April and 3,554 individuals have been confirmed positive.[163]
Treatment
